# DeepWay: International Diving Business Case Study

Exploring Shark Attacks

## **Introduction**

This case study highlights the significance of safety and risk management in diving tourism, particularly regarding shark encounters, which, despite being rare, can impact public perception. By analyzing historical shark attack data, geographic trends, and seasonal patterns, diving businesses can enhance operational planning, safety measures, and marketing strategies. This information helps ensure informed decision-making that meets customer expectations and promotes sustainable practices.

## **Problem Statement:**

Shark attack incidents vary based on environmental conditions, human activity, and seasonal factors, but there is limited understanding of which variables contribute the most to risk. This lack of insight affects safety measures, tourism decisions, and product innovations in high-risk areas.

## **Hypothesis :**

1. Shark attacks are more frequent near reefs and coastlines compared to open waters.
2. Certain regions (e.g., Australia, USA, South Africa) experience higher rates of shark-related incidents due to environmental conditions and human activity.
3. Activities such as snorkeling and swimming present a higher risk of shark encounters compared to other water sports.
4. Seasonality influences shark attack frequency, with peaks during summer and peak tourist seasons.
5. Shark attacks are predominantly non-fatal: given sharks typically bite out of curiosity rather than aggression, most encounters result in injuries rather than deaths.

## **EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA):**

![](data:image/png;base64...)

High concentration of attacks near reefs and coastal areas, supporting the hypothesis that sharks are more active where humans interact with shallow waters.

Only a small fraction in open waters, possibly because humans rarely venture far into deep ocean zones where shark encounters are less frequent.

A large number of "Unknown" locations, which could benefit from better classification—maybe using an API for geolocation or refining text recognition.

This confirms that the USA, Australia, and South Africa experience the highest shark attack rates, aligning with our hypothesis. Here's a breakdown of possible contributing factors:

USA (1,526 attacks) → Large coastal population, high tourism, many surfers/swimmers. Florida alone accounts for a significant share of attacks.

Australia (657 attacks) → Extensive coastline, thriving marine ecosystem with apex predators like great white sharks, and strong surfing culture.

South Africa (338 attacks) → Known for shark hotspots like Gansbaai and False Bay, with seasonal movements of great whites near shorelines.

Other countries (New Zealand, Bahamas, Brazil, etc.) → Lower attack counts, likely due to fewer human interactions with sharks.

Surfing (42.3%) → The most at-risk activity, likely due to surfers spending extended time in the water and making movements that resemble prey.

Swimming (24.1%) → Also a high-risk activity, possibly because swimmers are often in shallow waters where sharks hunt.

Fishing (15.8%) → May attract sharks due to bait and fish activity near boats.

Other Activities (12%) → Includes various water-based activities that don’t fit major categories.

Boarding (5.8%) → A lower-risk activity compared to the others.

January (1,903 incidents) shows an extreme spike—this seems highly unusual and could indicate data inconsistencies or an issue in data recording.

Relatively stable attack rates across other months, with no clear seasonal peak—June to September do not show a significant rise compared to colder months.

September (112 attacks) has a slightly higher count, which could be worth exploring further.

Most shark attack cases are non-fatal → 2449 incidents resulted in no fatality, making up the majority of recorded cases. This suggests that while shark attacks do occur, they are rarely deadly.

Fatal shark attacks account for a smaller proportion → 474 incidents led to fatalities. This indicates that although serious injuries can happen, most victims survive shark encounters.

120 cases classified as "Unknown" → These could be due to missing data, inconsistent reporting, or unclear outcomes in historical records.

## Conclusion :

Hypothesis 1 (Coastal/Reef vs Open Waters) → Supported. Most attacks occur near coastlines and reefs, likely due to higher human activity in these areas. Open water incidents remain rare.

Hypothesis 2 (Regional Differences in Attack Rates) → Confirmed. USA, Australia, and South Africa are the top three high-risk regions, likely due to shark population, coastal tourism, and water activities.

Hypothesis 3 (Activity Influence on Shark Encounters) → Validated. Surfing and swimming account for most shark attacks, confirming the risk factor linked to extended water exposure and movement patterns resembling prey.

Hypothesis 4 (Seasonality & Shark Attacks) → Partially Supported. While some months show fluctuations, the expected summer peak isn’t as strong as anticipated. January’s spike is unusual, suggesting potential data inconsistencies.

Hypothesis 5 (Fatal vs. Non-Fatal Outcomes) → Supported. Most shark attacks result in injuries rather than fatalities, confirming that sharks typically bite out of curiosity rather than aggression. The high survival rate suggests that while attacks can be severe, they are rarely deadly.
